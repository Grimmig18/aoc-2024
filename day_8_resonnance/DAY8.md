# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

## Challenge Description

### Part One

You find yourselves on the roof of a top-secret Easter Bunny installation.

While The Historians do their thing, you take a look at the familiar huge antenna. Much to your surprise, it seems to have been reconfigured to emit a signal that makes people 0.1% more likely to buy Easter Bunny brand Imitation Mediocre Chocolate as a Christmas gift! Unthinkable!

Scanning across the city, you find that there are actually many such antennas. Each antenna is tuned to a specific frequency indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit. You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas. For example:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

The signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific antinodes based on the resonant frequencies of the antennas. An antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other. This means for any pair of antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.

For example, given two antennas with frequency `a`, the two antinodes are marked as `#`:

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

Adding a third antenna with the same frequency creates several more antinodes. Some may go off the edges of the map, but within bounds, they might look like this:

```
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......#...
..........
..........
```

Antennas with different frequencies do not create antinodes (`A` and `a` are different frequencies). Antinodes can, however, occur at locations that contain antennas. For example:

```
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......A...
..........
..........
```

In this map, two different frequencies create antinodes:

```
......#....#
...#....0...
....#0....#.
..#....0....
....0....#..
.#....A.....
...#........
#......#....
........A...
.........A..
..........#.
..........#.
```

Because one antinode overlaps the topmost `A`-frequency antenna, there are 14 total unique locations containing an antinode within the bounds of the map.

**Task:** Calculate the impact of the signal. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

**Puzzle Answer (Part One):** 249

### Part Two

Watching over your shoulder, one of The Historians asks if you considered resonant harmonics in your calculations.

Whoops!

With resonant harmonics, an antinode occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance. Additionally, each antenna (unless it's the only one of its frequency) is itself an antinode.

For example:

```
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........
```

Here, the three `T`-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with two antennas, so they are all also antinodes! The total number of antinodes in this example is 9.

The original example now has 34 antinodes, including the antinodes that appear on every antenna:

```
##....#....#
.#.#....0...
..#.#0....#.
..##...0....
....0....#..
.#...#A....#
...#..#.....
#....#.#....
..#.....A...
....#....A..
.#........#.
...#......##
```

**Task:** Update your model to account for resonant harmonics. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

**Puzzle Answer (Part Two):** 905

## Notes

This challenge involves detecting antinodes based on specific geometric rules. Part Two introduces a more complex set of rules involving resonant harmonics, requiring careful tracking of antenna alignment and distances. Both parts are a great test of spatial reasoning and algorithm design.
